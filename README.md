# cruncher
Homemade generalized greedy search class I made for use in a seperate _top secret_ finance project

Quickly finds variables (parameters) that lead to some ideal result in reasonably high dimension problems.
<br />
Can be used to maximize or minimize complex python functions __without understanding anything about what's inside__
<br />
Does this incrementally through trial-and-error and scope reduction.


Example crunches are demonstrated if ran in "\_\_main__"
